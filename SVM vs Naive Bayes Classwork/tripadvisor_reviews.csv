1,Mebs,"Initially as a young family of four, we have been coming to Ginger Leaf, situated in the Hilton Hotel Jeddah for the past 7 years. 

It is the go to restaurant for it's consistent, amazing high quality Indian food, excellent ambience and environment, location and hospitality led by the amazing manager who after years has become a good friend, Mr. Nadeem. Along with his highly skilled Chefs and waiting staff we will forever cherish our amazing experiences of dining at Ginger Leaf.

To Mr. Nadeem and his team of staff, the Chefs and the front of house staff who have made our visit to Ginger Leaf so delightful over the years, we would like to express our sincere gratitude and kindness for the years of consistent service and high quality food. 

At every occasion we have visited we have enjoyed ourselves and thus it became a custom in our household that for birthdays, anniversaries or any celebration meals we would always come to Ginger Leaf. 

Our signature order, Hariyali Lamb Chops (devine), Chicken Tikka Massala (Perfection) Garlic Nans (best in Jeddah) was known by the staff throughout the years. Our boys now grown up, grew up loving the Lamb Chops and the Chicken Tikka Massala because of Ginger Leaf. No other restaurant in Jeddah even comes close to matching the standard and quality of food which we have come to be accustomed to. 

Thank you to all for the years of Great food and warm hospitality. 

Love The Master Family

If you haven't visited Ginger Leaf and love Indian food then book yourself a visit and treat yourself to an amazing meal experience."

4,Maurits V,"This Indian restaurant is located at the Hilton, lower lobby level. Quiet restaurant with attentive and friendly service. Extensive menu, difficult to choose from. The food was very good and very nicely presented. Large portions. I had asked medium spicy (to be careful) and that was not excessive. Maybe I should have gone for regular spicy. Overall an excellent experience at an affordable price. Good value for your money."

13,Yumi S,Found this restaurant on TripAdvisor and was not disappointed. The man who I assume is the boss was very helpful providing some guidance on what to have. Good ambiance. Great food. Excellent service. Garlic naan bread was delicious. Chicken marsala and seafood platter were stellar! Added a couple of naan to mop up the masala. Definitely will come back to try some other dishes.
