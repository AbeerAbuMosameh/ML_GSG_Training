1,Mebs,"Initially as a young family of four, we have been coming to Ginger Leaf, situated in the Hilton Hotel Jeddah for the past 7 years. 

It is the go to restaurant for it's consistent, amazing high quality Indian food, excellent ambience and environment, location and hospitality led by the amazing manager who after years has become a good friend, Mr. Nadeem. Along with his highly skilled Chefs and waiting staff we will forever cherish our amazing experiences of dining at Ginger Leaf.

To Mr. Nadeem and his team of staff, the Chefs and the front of house staff who have made our visit to Ginger Leaf so delightful over the years, we would like to express our sincere gratitude and kindness for the years of consistent service and high quality food. 

At every occasion we have visited we have enjoyed ourselves and thus it became a custom in our household that for birthdays, anniversaries or any celebration meals we would always come to Ginger Leaf. 

Our signature order, Hariyali Lamb Chops (devine), Chicken Tikka Massala (Perfection) Garlic Nans (best in Jeddah) was known by the staff throughout the years. Our boys now grown up, grew up loving the Lamb Chops and the Chicken Tikka Massala because of Ginger Leaf. No other restaurant in Jeddah even comes close to matching the standard and quality of food which we have come to be accustomed to. 

Thank you to all for the years of Great food and warm hospitality. 

Love The Master Family

If you haven't visited Ginger Leaf and love Indian food then book yourself a visit and treat yourself to an amazing meal experience."

3,Stephan,"We enjoyed a memorable evening at the Ginger Leaf restaurant. The food was excellent, and the service exceptional. The Head Chef explained the dishes in detail at the table, making it easy for us to make the proper selection. Thanks for a great evening, and we will be back soon."
4,Maurits V,"This Indian restaurant is located at the Hilton, lower lobby level. Quiet restaurant with attentive and friendly service. Extensive menu, difficult to choose from. The food was very good and very nicely presented. Large portions. I had asked medium spicy (to be careful) and that was not excessive. Maybe I should have gone for regular spicy. Overall an excellent experience at an affordable price. Good value for your money."

13,Yumi S,Found this restaurant on TripAdvisor and was not disappointed. The man who I assume is the boss was very helpful providing some guidance on what to have. Good ambiance. Great food. Excellent service. Garlic naan bread was delicious. Chicken marsala and seafood platter were stellar! Added a couple of naan to mop up the masala. Definitely will come back to try some other dishes.

27,Rana0426,"Had chicken tikka masala, mix veg, variety of naan,made me comfortable to live in Jeddah. Restaurant is small but impressive and attractive. Service is really good and staff is polite in nature. Best part is that you will not only return with satisfied tummy but also with a good friend added to your list who is none other than Mr Nadeem. This guy talks to you and make you feel comfortable with food and place in no time. I am in touch with him and also met few other folks there. Overall, this place is not only to just go and have food but also to make you feel like at home specifically for Indians."
28,Mohammed Azam,"This restaurant has really gone down the pits. I came here twice before for family dinners and was very satisfied. I don't know whether it is a change of management or the chefs but it is unspeakably worse than even some of the the most known budget-friendly Indian restaurants. Last night I had booked a large family dinner for an occasion and good heavens was it a massive tragedy. The meat items (kebabs, nihari, raan) on the menu were all just plain bad without the flavor and barely edible. Same with the mutton biryani we ordered. The chicken meethi malai, butter chicken, prawn chaat and dilli chaat were good but still unacceptable considering the pedigree and price category of this restaurant. I didn't even order dessert because the food left such a bad taste. The manager knocked the price off of one item because I complained but after getting back home both me and two of my guests got sick. I'm suspecting it was one of the meat items. I had given this place a glowing review on TripAdvisor before, so posting a new one to let people know just how downhill this place has gone."
29,Venture819118,its amazing dinner with family .nice and delouses food especially chicken tikka masala bhuna ghost and tandoori chicken and yummy murg mallei kebab its amazing food and nice service .
